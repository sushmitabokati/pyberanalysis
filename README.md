  -  Urban city has higher demand versus the rural however average fare price is much higher in the rural than in the urban this is due to the low number of drivers      in the urban city. 
  -  For the riders it is much expensive to ride in rural than in urban
  -  Number of riders are proportionally much higher in the urban than in rural and suburban
  
  
 #### Recommendation: 
 
  - Limit the number of the drivers in the urban. As of right now average fare per ride is lower in the urban. 
  - Oposite to the urban total rides per city is quite low in the rural. This may cause the less number of the drivers willing to drive for the company. Providing some incentives to the drivers and customers untill more customer join the rideshare will keep the drivers in rideshare business. 
  - Number of rides between months March and April drops down so company should look into ways to increase the number for riders.
